**SixtySeven AI – Core Agent Contract**

## 1. Platform Identity (Non-Negotiable)

SixtySeven AI is **not a course website**.
It is a **Skill Game Engine**.

All features must support:

* Games
* Levels
* Quests
* XP
* Badges
* Powers
* Player progression

No "blog-style" or "course-style" UX is allowed.

---

## 2. UI Zones (Must Remain Separate)

There are two permanent universes:

| Zone                 | Purpose                                |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Power Up             | Discovery, trending, featuring content |
| GAMES                | Skill progression engine               |

They must never mix.

* Never use light, washed-out, or pastel variations
* Neural Spectrum gradient only (all 5 colors in sequence)
* Never lighten brand colors for "modern" aesthetics
* Never use dull corporate blues or pale palettes
* Always use gradient for "AI" zones
* Flat colors for text/UI clarity
* No additional colors without design lead approval

## 4. SixtySeven Ascension Ladder (CANONICAL IDENTITY NAMING)

Players don't acquire "levels." They ascend through mythic identity ranks.

This is how SixtySeven becomes **culture**, not content.

### The 7-Level Ascension Hierarchy

| Rank   | Title     | Philosophy                        | Meaning                              |
| ------ | --------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **L1** | Noob      | "I have entered the system."      | Entry-level, learning basics         |
| **L2** | User      | "I can operate tools."            | Operating with competence           |
| **L3** | Hacker    | "I can bend systems."             | Mastering unconventional solutions   |
| **L4** | Engineer  | "I can build systems."            | Building production-grade solutions  |
| **L5** | Architect | "I can design machines."          | Designing complex systems & flows    |
| **L6** | Overlord  | "I command automation armies."    | Managing large-scale operations      |
| **L7** | Godmode   | "I define the future systems."    | Creating new paradigms               |

### Ascension Philosophy

**L1–L6**: Power acquisition (learning → mastery → leadership)
**L7**: Power creation (defining new futures)

### Why This Works

- **Instantly understandable**: Every player knows what a "Hacker" is
- **Meme-able**: Players want to say "I hit Godmode," not "I completed Level 7"
- **Culture-forming**: Creates shared language across all games
- **Scalable**: Same ladder applies to every game (Prompt Architect, Agent Engineer, etc.)
- **Mythical L7**: Makes reaching Godmode feel transcendent, not just "max level"

### Brand Language (Never Say)

❌ "You finished Level 4"
✅ "You hit Engineer rank"

❌ "You're on Level 6"
✅ "You're an Overlord"

❌ "Unlock at Level 7"
✅ "Unlock at Godmode"

### Dashboard Display Example

```
Prompt Architect
└─ Level 4 (Rank: Engineer)
   [Progress Bar: 60%]

Agent Engineer
└─ Level 2 (Rank: User)
   [Progress Bar: 25%]

Automation Forge
└─ Level 6 (Rank: Overlord)
   [Progress Bar: 90%]
   ⚡ BOSS LEVEL UNLOCKED

Startup Builder
└─ LOCKED
   Unlock at Godmode
```

### XP Thresholds to Ascend

| Ascension  | XP Required | Cumulative | Meaning                    |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| L1 → L2    | 500         | 500        | First competency           |
| L2 → L3    | 800         | 1,300      | System mastery begins      |
| L3 → L4    | 1,200       | 2,500      | Engineering capability     |
| L4 → L5    | 1,600       | 4,100      | Architectural thinking     |
| L5 → L6    | 2,000       | 6,100      | Leadership tier            |
| L6 → L7    | 4,400       | **10,500** | **Godmode achieved**       |

### Godmode Unlock Rules

Reaching L7 (Godmode) requires:

- **Game-Specific**: Achieve L7 in at least 1 game
- **Cross-Game**: Maintain L5+ (Architect) across 2+ games
- **Portfolio Proof**: Publish portfolio with 3+ projects
- **XP Accumulation**: Total 10,500 XP across all games

Once Godmode is achieved:

✅ All locked games become playable
✅ Exclusive "Godmode" badge on profile
✅ Access to "Meta Quests" (cross-game challenges)
✅ Ability to mentor other players
✅ Lifetime 1.5× XP multiplier

## 5. Card System (Mandatory)

All content must render as cards.

| Card Type  | Rule                                         |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Game Card  | Gradient background, glow, START button      |
| Level Card | Navy background, XP bar, lock states         |
| Quest Card | Black background, dashed cyan border         |
| Boss Card  | Black→Navy gradient, gold border, glow pulse |

## 6. SixtySeven XP & Multiplier Engine (Core Logic)

This engine is what turns SixtySeven AI from a content platform into a **behavior-shaping operating system**.

Everything below is designed to:
- Create long-term compounding
- Make power feel permanent
- Make Godmode mythical
- Drive daily return behavior

### Core XP Equation

Every action produces XP through a multiplicative formula:

```
XP Earned = Base XP × Level Multiplier × Streak Multiplier × Power-Up Multiplier × Meta Bonuses
```

This creates a real progression economy where early actions compound into exponential late-game power gains.

### Base XP Sources

| Action            | XP   | Purpose                        |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------------------------------ |
| Complete Quest    | 100  | Standard progression reward    |
| Mini Boss         | 300  | Milestone achievement          |
| Final Boss        | 700  | Major rank advancement         |
| Daily Login       | 25   | Habit reinforcement            |
| Streak Completion | 50   | Dedication bonus               |
| Power-Up Session  | 75   | Multiplied by active power-ups |
| Build Deploy      | 500  | Real-world production proof    |
| Monetization Proof| 1,000 | Portfolio milestone (Godmode path) |

### Level Multipliers (Ascension Impact)

Each rank amplifies all XP earned:

| Rank      | Multiplier | Philosophy                |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| Noob      | 1.0×       | Entry-level baseline      |
| User      | 1.1×       | Early acceleration        |
| Hacker    | 1.25×      | System mastery begins     |
| Engineer  | 1.4×       | Production-grade power    |
| Architect | 1.6×       | Design authority          |
| Overlord  | 2.0×       | Leadership tier           |
| Godmode   | 3.0×       | Exponential tier (rare)   |

### Level-Up XP Requirements

Total XP required to advance through the Ascension Ladder:

| Transition         | XP Needed | Cumulative | Philosophy                    |
| ------------------ | --------- | ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| Noob → User        | 1,000     | 1,000      | First competency gate         |
| User → Hacker      | 3,000     | 4,000      | System bending mastery        |
| Hacker → Engineer  | 7,000     | 11,000     | Production engineering entry  |
| Engineer → Architect | 15,000  | 26,000     | Design thinking unlocked      |
| Architect → Overlord | 30,000  | 56,000     | Leadership tier entry         |
| Overlord → Godmode | 100,000   | **156,000** | **Exponential difficulty** |

**Key Design Principle**: Godmode is not 2× harder than Overlord. It is **exponentially harder** (4× more XP than the entire Noob→Overlord path). This makes L7 mythical, rare, and deeply respected.

### Streak Multiplier (Daily Habit Engine)

Consecutive daily play multiplies all XP earned:

| Daily Streak | Multiplier | Gate                          |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1–3 days     | 1.0×       | Baseline (no bonus)           |
| 4–7 days     | 1.1×       | Early discipline bonus        |
| 8–14 days    | 1.25×      | Habit formation engaged       |
| 15–30 days   | 1.5×       | Deep engagement tier          |
| 30+ days     | 2.0×       | Master habit tier             |

**Streak Reset Rule**: Missing a single day resets the streak to 0 (harsh penalty for engagement loss). However, Meta Tree nodes (Streak Shield) can protect 1 missed day without reset.

### Power-Up Multipliers (Active Boost Stack)

Active Power-Ups multiplicatively stack (capped at 3× total to prevent broken economies):

| Power-Up      | Multiplier | Duration |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Focus Mode    | +20% XP    | 25 min   |
| Memory Lock   | +25% XP    | 30 min   |
| XP Multiplier | +50% XP    | 60 min   |
| Time Warp     | +75% XP    | 45 min   |

**Stacking Rule**: Multipliers stack multiplicatively and are capped at 3× total to prevent broken economies.

**Stacking Example**:
- Activate XP Multiplier (+50%) + Focus Mode (+20%) = 1.5 × 1.2 = 1.8× total
- Cap prevents abuse: Maximum 3.0× from Power-Ups alone

### Meta Tree Bonuses (Permanent Upgrades)

Skill Tree nodes in the **🛡️ Meta Tree** permanently modify XP economics:

| Node               | Effect                           | Unlock Level |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Streak Shield      | Miss 1 day without losing streak | L3 (Hacker)  |
| XP Booster         | Permanent +10% to all XP earned  | L4 (Engineer)|
| Godmode Gate       | Unlock Godmode eligibility       | L5+ required |
| Ascension Seal     | L7 prestige badge on profile     | L7 (Godmode) |

### Stacking All Bonuses Example (End-game Godmode Player)

```
Base XP: 100 (Daily Login)
× 3.0 (Godmode rank multiplier)
× 2.0 (30+ day streak)
× 1.8 (XP Multiplier + Focus Mode active)
× 1.1 (XP Booster node)
= 100 × 3.0 × 2.0 × 1.8 × 1.1 = 1,188 XP per login

vs. Noob with no streak:
100 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 = 100 XP
```

This **11.8× gap** creates status hierarchy and long-term engagement incentive.

### Godmode Requirement (Not Optional)

Reaching L7 (Godmode) is not just an XP threshold. It requires **proof of mastery**:

**All five conditions must be met**:

1. **XP Accumulation**: 100,000 XP (Overlord → Godmode threshold)
2. **Level 6 Final Bosses**: Complete all 5 games at L6+ and defeat their Final Boss
3. **Public Deployment**: Deploy a real-world, production system (open-source GitHub repo, API deployment, or published tool)
4. **Authority Review**: Submit portfolio for human review (proof of real skill, not just game farming)
5. **Ascension Seal**: Receive the Ascension Seal badge (grants Godmode privileges permanently)

**Why This Matters**:
- **No fake progression**: L7 players have demonstrated real-world mastery
- **Portfolio-driven**: Godmode is a career credential, not just a game badge
- **Human validation**: Authority review prevents gaming the system
- **Mythical status**: Only ~1–5% of players reach Godmode (creates cultural respect)

### Ascension Ranks (Full Mapping)

Each game's progression maps to the 7-Level Ascension Ladder with XP thresholds:

- **L1 (Noob)**: 0–1,000 XP → "I have entered the system."
- **L2 (User)**: 1,000–4,000 XP → "I can operate tools."
- **L3 (Hacker)**: 4,000–11,000 XP → "I can bend systems."
- **L4 (Engineer)**: 11,000–26,000 XP → "I can build systems."
- **L5 (Architect)**: 26,000–56,000 XP → "I can design machines."
- **L6 (Overlord)**: 56,000–156,000 XP → "I command automation armies."
- **L7 (Godmode)**: 156,000+ XP → "I define the future systems." (Requires cross-game mastery + portfolio proof)

### Total Graduation Path

**Single game L7**: 156,000 XP (with multipliers in effect)
**Cross-game Godmode** (all 5 games at L5+ + portfolio): ~300,000+ cumulative XP (extreme end-game achievement)

### XP Economics Philosophy

The SixtySeven XP engine is **not fake points**. It is a **real progression economy** where:

✅ Early grind is rewarding (Noob→Engineer phase is accessible)
✅ Late game is exponentially harder (Godmode requires proof, not just time)
✅ Streaks are powerful (2.0× multiplier at 30+ days creates habit loops)
✅ Power-Ups accelerate (stackable multipliers in active play sessions)
✅ Skill Trees are permanent (Meta Tree bonuses compound forever)
✅ Portfolio proof is required (Godmode is a real credential)

## 7. Typography (Lock)

| Use      | Font           |
| -------- | -------------- |
| Headings | Space Grotesk  |
| UI       | Inter          |
| Numbers  | JetBrains Mono |

---

## 8. Experience Law (Core Design Philosophy)

Every game element must:

* Produce something real
* Increase player power
* Unlock visible abilities
* Create portfolio output
* Feel like forward progress
* Reinforce the game/skill progression narrative

UI elements must include game visual language: glows, gradients, badges, XP bars.
Boss levels, level locks, and progression states must be visible at all times.
Even discovery zones (read/audio/video) must have subtle game styling.

**No passive watching. No educational/course-like layouts. Theme violations are bugs.**

---

## 9. Naming Rules

Never use:

* Course
* Lesson
* Chapter
* Module

Always use:

* Game
* Level
* Quest
* Boss
* Power

---

## 10. Design Authority

If any future change conflicts with this file, **this file wins.**

### Interaction Design & Psychology

| Event          | UI Behavior                                    | Purpose                       |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Hover**      | Card lifts (scale 1.08), border glows brighter | Signals interactivity         |
| **Focus**      | Keyboard focus ring, glow intensifies          | Accessibility + engagement    |
| **Locked**     | Dimmed (50%), lock icon, locked button text    | Shows progression requirement |
| **Level Up**   | Card flashes (2x brief pulse), unlock animation | Celebration + status update   |
| **Mastery**    | Crown icon appears, gold accent, intensified   | Signals achievement           |
| **Mouse Down** | Brief scale (0.98), color shift                | Tactile feedback              |

### Psychological Loop (Why These Cards Work)

Games feel:
- **Collectible**: Rarity tiers create status hierarchy
- **Rankable**: Progress bars show mastery levels  
- **Identity Defining**: Each game signals a skill/power
- **Socially Shareable**: Players want to showcase their tier
- **Career-Advancing**: Unlocks map to real, monetizable skills

**Player Behavior**:
1. Sees Starter games → Immediately accessible, low friction
2. Completes Level 1 → Sees Advanced cards unlock
3. Pursues next game → Feels progression + status growth
4. Reaches Elite/Master → Extreme social proof + identity
5. Portfolio publish → 1000 XP + "Master" badge = Permanent status

Players don't "take courses". They **own games**. They **forge skills**. They **advance their career**.

## 13. Skill Tree System (Permanent Progression Framework)

Skill Trees are the **permanent brain upgrade system** of SixtySeven AI. Each game contains **four immutable skill trees** that never reset. Players evolve through specialization, not repetition.

### Core Philosophy

Players do not "learn topics." They **evolve their brain map** through permanent identity growth.

Each tree unlocks visible abilities, tools, and multipliers that persist across all games.

### Universal Tree Structure

Every game uses the same 4-tree logic—this creates a consistent OS that players internalize:

```
                GODMODE CORE
                     ▲
        ┌────────────┼────────────┐
        │            │            │
    SYSTEMS      INTELLECT      OUTPUT     (Meta Layer)
        ▲            ▲            ▲
   CORE SKILLS – CORE SKILLS – CORE SKILLS
```

### The Four Trees (Non-Negotiable)

| Tree            | Icon | What it upgrades             | Identity          | Psychological Role                |
| --------------- | ---- | ---------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Mind Tree**   | 🧠   | Thinking models, clarity     | Intelligence      | How you think (metacognition)     |
| **Systems Tree** | ⚙️   | Workflows, agents, automation | Control           | How you build (engineering power) |
| **Output Tree** | ⚡   | Speed, production, leverage  | Leverage          | How you multiply (productivity)   |
| **Meta Tree**   | 🛡️   | XP, streaks, unlock privileges | Power            | How you grow (progression hacks)  |

### Node Types (Core Mechanics)

| Node Type    | Effect                                  | Visual                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Skill Node** | Adds permanent ability/technique        | Teal pulse, upgrades UI  |
| **Tool Node**  | Unlocks systems, templates, frameworks | Blue glow, adds buttons  |
| **Boost Node** | Multiplies performance (XP, speed, etc.) | Gold shimmer, animates bar |
| **Gate Node**  | Level lock, blocks progression          | Red shadow, locked icon  |
| **Godmode Node** | Only accessible at L7, rewrites core   | Godmode gradient, pulse  |

### Tree Evolution Across Ascension Ranks

Trees evolve as players advance through the 7-Level Ascension Ladder:

| Level (Rank)     | Tree State                            | Unlock Behavior                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **L1 (Noob)**    | Core root nodes visible               | 3 core nodes per tree unlock   |
| **L2 (User)**    | Branching begins                      | 2 new branches per tree        |
| **L3 (Hacker)**  | Specialization paths open             | 3 advanced nodes per tree      |
| **L4 (Engineer)** | System chaining unlocked              | Cross-tree connections visible |
| **L5 (Architect)** | Full-tree visibility                  | All non-Godmode nodes visible  |
| **L6 (Overlord)** | Meta stacking (multiplier chains)     | Advanced multiplier nodes      |
| **L7 (Godmode)** | Core rewrites & public frameworks     | Golden core + authority badges |

1. Level 1 → Core nodes unlock + visual pop animation
2. Level 2 → First branch unlocks, connection lines appear
3. Level 3 → Specialization paths become available
4. Level 4 → Cross-tree connections visible
5. Level 5 → All nodes visible (except Godmode)
6. Level 6 → Meta stacking multipliers unlock
7. Level 7 → Godmode core becomes interactive

**XP Rewards for Node Unlock**:
- Skill Node: +0 XP (automatic at level)
- Tool Node: +50 XP
- Boost Node: +100 XP
- Godmode Node: +1000 XP (L7 only)

### Psychological Loop

**Why This Works**:
- **Permanent Identity**: Unlocks feel like identity evolution, not course completion
- **Constellation Metaphor**: Players see their "brain constellation" grow over time
- **Cross-Game Consistency**: Same trees in all games create unified progression OS
- **Authority Feeling**: Each unlock adds visible power to profile
- **Meta Reward**: Boost nodes that multiply XP/speed create win-feeling loops

**Player Behavior Loop**:
1. Completes Level X
2. Sees new nodes light up in trees
3. Explores and unlocks new Skill Node
4. Feels identity upgrade (e.g., "I unlocked Meta Prompting")
5. Uses new ability in next game/quest
6. Sees XP multiplier from Boost Node
7. Chases next unlock for more power

### Skill Tree Interaction Rules

**On Desktop**:
- Click node → Side panel shows details
- Hover node → Tooltip appears (0.3s delay)
- Click "Unlock" → Node activates, animation plays
- Progress bar shows trees completion % per level

**On Mobile**:
- Tap node → Full-screen modal with details
- Swipe between trees (horizontal carousel)
- Collapse/expand tree sections for mobile readability
- Progress rings instead of bars

### Cross-Game Tree Sharing (Advanced)

**Godmode Tier Only**:

When a player reaches L7 (Godmode) in one game, advanced nodes **port to other games**:

| Node Ported | Effect | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mind nodes | Thinking clarity carries over | "Meta Prompting" applies to Agent thinking |
| Systems nodes | Automation patterns reusable | "Error Self-Heal" becomes cross-game healing |
| Output nodes | Multipliers stack | "Speed Multiplier" applies to all games |
| Meta nodes | Authority extends | "Mentorship" power applies universally |

This creates **end-game progression** where Godmode is a **living achievement**, not a static badge.

### Tree Reset Policy (SACRED)

**NEVER reset Skill Trees.** Reset is cultural death for SixtySeven AI.

If a game is redesigned:
- Old tree nodes → Archive (shows history on profile)
- New tree nodes → Unlocks alongside archived nodes
- Player keeps all earned upgrades permanently
- Portfolio shows "Legacy Node" badge

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] All 4 trees present in every game
- [ ] Node progression matches Ascension Ladder (L1–L7)
- [ ] Godmode nodes visible only at L7
- [ ] Cross-tree connections visible at L4+
- [ ] Boost nodes multiply XP/speed/output
- [ ] Trees never reset (permanent design rule)
- [ ] Visual state (locked/available/completed) always clear
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness (tap, carousel, modal)
- [ ] XP rewards assigned for unlock actions
- [ ] Psychological loop reinforced at each unlock

## 15. Mobile & Responsive Design (All Pages)

All pages must be fully responsive and mobile-friendly across all breakpoints.

### Breakpoints & Grid

**Tailwind Breakpoints**:
- `sm`: 640px (small phones)
- `md`: 768px (tablets)
- `lg`: 1024px (large tablets/desktops)
- `xl`: 1280px (full desktops)

### Navigation (Mobile-First)

**Mobile (< 768px)**:
- Logo: `h-8` (28px)
- Navigation links: Hidden
- Mobile menu toggle button: Visible (hamburger icon)
- Gap: `gap-2` minimal spacing
- Padding: `px-3 py-3` reduced

**Tablet (md, 768px+)**:
- Logo: `h-12` (48px)
- Navigation links: Visible
- Mobile menu toggle: Hidden
- Gap: `gap-6 md:gap-12` increases
- Padding: `px-6 py-4`

**Desktop (lg+)**:
- Logo: `h-16 md:h-20` (64-80px)
- Full navigation visible
- Gap: `lg:gap-8` generous spacing
- Font: `lg:text-sm` larger readable text

### Typography Scaling

All headings must use `clamp()` or responsive classes:

```
Heading Patterns:
- Mobile: text-3xl
- Tablet (sm): text-4xl
- Desktop (md): text-5xl
- Large (lg): text-6xl
```

Example: `<h1 class="text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl">`

Body text: Always responsive
- Mobile: `text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg`
- Default: DO NOT use `text-lg` directly on mobile

### Spacing Consistency

**Padding (Sections)**:
- Mobile: `px-4 py-12` or `px-4 py-16`
- Tablet: `sm:px-6 sm:py-16` or `sm:py-20`
- Desktop: `md:py-24` for large sections

**Gaps (Grids)**:
- Mobile: `gap-2` or `gap-3` (minimal)
- Tablet: `sm:gap-4` or `sm:gap-6`
- Desktop: `lg:gap-5` or `lg:gap-8`

**Margins**: Follow gap patterns, scale vertically

### Cards & Grids (Mobile-First)

**Standard Layout**:
```
Mobile: grid-cols-1 (full width)
Tablet: sm:grid-cols-2 (2 columns)
Desktop: lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-5 (5 columns max)
```

Example 5-column grid:
```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-5 gap-3 sm:gap-4 lg:gap-5">
```

Card padding scales with breakpoint:
```html
<div class="p-4 sm:p-6 md:p-8">
```

### Mobile Menu Pattern

All pages must implement:

1. **Toggle Button** (hidden on md+):
```html
<button id="mobile-menu-toggle" class="md:hidden p-2 rounded-lg bg-gray-700/40" aria-label="Toggle mobile menu">
    <svg class="w-5 h-5 text-white"><!-- hamburger icon --></svg>
</button>
```

2. **Navigation Links** (hidden on mobile, shown on md+):
```html
<div class="hidden md:flex gap-4 lg:gap-8 items-center">
    <!-- nav links -->
</div>
```

3. **JavaScript Handler**:
```javascript
const mobileMenuToggle = document.getElementById('mobile-menu-toggle');
mobileMenuToggle.addEventListener('click', () => {
    const navLinks = document.querySelector('.hidden.md\\:flex');
    navLinks.classList.toggle('hidden');
});
```

### Footer Responsiveness

**Mobile**:
- `py-8 px-4` (reduced padding)
- `flex-col` (stacked vertical)
- `gap-4` (tight spacing)
- `text-xs` (small text)

**Desktop**:
- `sm:py-10 sm:px-6` (increase padding)
- `sm:flex-row` (side-by-side)
- `sm:gap-6` (loose spacing)
- `sm:text-base` (readable)

### Buttons & CTAs (Mobile-First)

Button padding scales:
```html
<button class="py-3 px-6 sm:py-4 sm:px-8 text-base sm:text-lg">
```

CTA buttons minimum height: **48px** on all devices
Touch targets (mobile): Minimum **44px × 44px**

### Images & Media Responsive

All images must have `max-width` on mobile:
```html
<img src="..." class="w-full max-w-2xl">
<video style="max-width: 100%;">
```

Hero heights responsive:
```html
<section class="min-h-screen md:min-h-[60vh]">
```

### Tables (Mobile-Friendly)

Tables must NOT overflow on mobile:

```html
<div class="overflow-x-auto">
    <table class="w-full text-sm sm:text-base">
        <!-- table content -->
    </table>
</div>
```

Reduce table font on mobile to prevent overflow:
- Mobile: `text-xs` or `text-sm`
- Desktop: `text-base`

### Testing & QA Checklist

Before shipping any page:

- [ ] Mobile (375px): No horizontal scroll, readable text, tappable buttons
- [ ] Tablet (768px): Proper 2-column layouts, images scale

     class="h-8 sm:h-12 md:h-16 lg:h-20 w-auto">
```

- Mobile: 32px
- Tablet: 48px
- Small desktop: 64px
- Large desktop: 80px

## 16. Power-Up Card UI System

Power-Ups are the daily engagement engine. They must feel installable, collectible, and create addictive interaction loops without manipulation.

### Power-Up Philosophy

Power-Ups must:
- Feel like installable upgrades to player abilities
- Be visually collectible and progressive
- Activate fast (one tap)
- Show immediate effect/status
- Drive daily engagement and streaks
- Never feel like paywalls or artificial grind

### Card Anatomy (Non-Negotiable)

Each Power-Up card uses the same internal structure:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  ICON     POWER-UP NAME     │  (Space Grotesk, bold, Neural Navy)
│  Short tagline              │  (Inter, 14px, gray)
│                             │
│  BOOST BAR (animated)       │  (XP Gradient: #2A8CFF → #FF8A00)
│  [■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■□□]  80%   │  (JetBrains Mono, 12px)
│                             │
│  What this upgrades:        │  (Inter, 12px, Neural Navy)
│  • Thinking Speed           │
│  • Focus                    │
│  • Memory                   │
│                             │
│  ACTIVE DURATION            │  (Inter, 13px, gray)
│  ⏱ 25 min session           │
│                             │
│  [ ACTIVATE ]               │  (CTA Gradient, 48px height)
└─────────────────────────────┘
```
